# covid-19-risk-estimator
This repository hosts the diagnostic-code condition mappings used by A3.AI to produce the datasets on which The Economist's covid-19 risk estimator was trained. We have also included the scripts we used to train these models to provide transparency on our methods. For access to the data itself, please visit covid19researchdatabase.org.

To learn more about this process and what the models and data suggests, please see our methodology and accompanying article.
